Approach
Initialize a HashSet cities to store all cities with outgoing paths.
Iterate through the paths and add the starting city of each path to the cities set.
Iterate through the paths again and check the destination city of each path. If the destination city is not in the cities set, it means there is no outgoing path from that city, so return it as the destination city.
