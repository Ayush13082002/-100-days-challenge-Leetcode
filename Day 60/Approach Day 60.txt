Approach
Calculate the number of complete weeks (week_count = n / 7).
Calculate the total contribution from complete weeks using the arithmetic sum formula for each week: ((week_count * (week_count - 1)) / 2) * 7.
Calculate the total contribution from days beyond complete weeks using the arithmetic sum formula: (week_count * 28).
Calculate the contribution from the remaining days (less than a week) using the arithmetic sum formula for the remaining days: ((remaining_days * (remaining_days + 1)) / 2) + (week_count * remaining_days).
Sum up the contributions calculated in steps 2, 3, and 4 to get the total amount.
