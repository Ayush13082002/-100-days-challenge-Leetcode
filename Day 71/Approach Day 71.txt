Approach
Create a class Info to represent a combination of food, cuisine, and rating.
Use two maps: foodMap to store food information, and cuisineMap to store cuisine-specific PriorityQueues of Info objects.
In the constructor, populate these maps based on the input arrays.
For changeRating method, update the rating in foodMap and remove the corresponding Info object from the cuisineMap PriorityQueue.
For highestRated method, continuously remove Info objects with empty food names from the PriorityQueue until a valid food name is found.
