Approach 
If we observe a bit the number of substrings of size needle length is length of haystack minus length of needle+1 so using two pointer we just used a for loop till (length of haystack-length of needle) and then checked if the character in needle is equal to character of haystack. If its equal we just kept on incrementing j. If the j is equal to needle length then we found our first substring that is equal to needle and we return the index of first character of that substring. If we dont find the substring in the haystack then we simply return -1.
