Approach
Initialize an array freq to count the frequency of each element in nums.
Iterate over the elements in reverse order (from the largest to the smallest).
For each element, update the operations and result.
Operations are incremented by the frequency of the current element.
Result is updated by adding the current operations minus the frequency of the current element.
Return the final result.
