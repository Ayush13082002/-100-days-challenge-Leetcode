Approach
Create a 2D array MOVES to represent the possible moves for each digit on the phone pad.
Use a recursive function knightDialer to calculate the count of distinct phone numbers.
Use a cache (cache array) to store previously computed results for optimization.
If remaining is 1, return the length of nextNumbers, indicating that the knight can be placed on any of the available numbers.
Otherwise, iterate through each number in nextNumbers and recursively calculate the count for the remaining moves (remaining - 1) using the possible moves for the current number.
Update the cache with the calculated result and return the total count.
