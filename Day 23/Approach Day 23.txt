Approach
Our approach is straightforward:

Convert each number into its binary representation using the bin() function.
Count the number of 1's using the count('1') method.
Sort the numbers first by the count of 1's and then by the number itself.
Python's sorted function will use the first element of the tuple for sorting and if there's a tie, it'll use the second element.
