Approach
Initialize a variable result to store the maximum digit of the good integer found so far. Set it to -1 initially.
Iterate through the string num from index 0 to num.length() - 3.
Check if the substring of length 3 starting at the current index consists of only one unique digit. If yes, update the result to be the maximum of the current digit and the existing result.
After the loop, if result is still -1, it means no good integer was found, so return an empty string.
Otherwise, construct the maximum good integer using the digit stored in result and return it.
