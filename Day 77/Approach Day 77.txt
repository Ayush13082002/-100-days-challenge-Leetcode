Approach
Create a map moves to map the characters 'N', 'S', 'E', 'W' to their respective coordinate changes.
Initialize a set visited to store the visited locations. Add the starting location (0, 0) to the set.
Traverse the path character by character:
Update the current position based on the move.
Create a pair of the current position.
Check if the pair is already in the visited set. If yes, return true as the path crosses itself.
Otherwise, add the pair to the visited set.
If the traversal completes without finding any crossing, return false.
