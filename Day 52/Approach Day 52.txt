Approach
Initialize variables to keep track of chairs, result, and iterate through the corridor.
When a seat ('S') is encountered, count it, skip any plants ('P') until the next seat is found, and count that seat as well.
After identifying adjacent pairs of seats, count the divisions between them and consider each plant as an additional division.
If there are extra divisions (more than one) and more characters in the corridor, update the result accordingly.
Repeat the process until the end of the corridor is reached.
Check if there are chairs and an even number of chairs, then return the final result; otherwise, return 0.
