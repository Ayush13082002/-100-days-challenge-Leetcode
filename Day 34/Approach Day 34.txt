Approach
int diff = right - left + 1; calculates the number of integers in the range. For example, if left is 2 and right is 5, diff will be 4 because the range includes 2, 3, 4, and 5.

int ans = 0; initializes the result variable to 0. This variable will store the bitwise AND of all numbers in the range.

The code enters a loop that iterates from i = 0 to i = 31. This loop examines each bit position from the least significant bit (LSB) to the most significant bit (MSB) because integers are represented by 32 bits in Java.

Inside the loop, the code checks if diff is less than or equal to 1 << i. This condition tests if there are fewer than or equal to 2^i numbers in the range. If true, it means that the i-th bit in the binary representation of the numbers in the range is not the same for all numbers. In this case, ans is updated.

ans += (right) & (1 << i) & (left); performs a bitwise AND operation on right, 1 << i, and left. This operation checks if the i-th bit is set (1) in both right and left. If it is, the result is a non-zero value, which is added to ans. This effectively means that the i-th bit is common to all numbers in the range, and it is included in the final result.

After the loop, ans contains the bitwise AND of all numbers in the given range, considering each bit position.

the code calculates the bitwise AND of all numbers in the specified range by comparing each bit of the numbers in the range and including only the bits that are common to all numbers. The final result is the bitwise AND of the entire range.
