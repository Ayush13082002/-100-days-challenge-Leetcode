Approach
Initialize a StringBuilder (res) to construct the final string representation.
Implement a recursive depth-first search (DFS) function (dfs) to traverse the binary tree.
Append the current node's value to the result string.
Check if the current node has left and right children:
If it has only a left child, append '(' and recursively call dfs on the left child.
If it has both left and right children, append '(' and recursively call dfs on both the left and right children.
After handling the left children, if the current node has a right child, append '(' and recursively call dfs on the right child.
Close the parenthesis after handling the left and right children.
The final result is obtained as a string from the StringBuilder.
