Approach
Iterate through each cell in the image matrix.
For each cell, calculate the sum of the values of the cell and its eight surrounding cells.
Count the number of valid cells included in the sum.
Set the value of the corresponding cell in the result matrix as the floor of the sum divided by the count.
Return the result matrix.
