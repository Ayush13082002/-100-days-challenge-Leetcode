Approach
First, we check if the length of the array is 1. If it is, all strings are already equal, so we return true.
Calculate the total character count across all strings.
If the total character count is not divisible by the number of strings, it is impossible to make them equal, so return false.
Initialize an array myMap to count the occurrences of each character.
Traverse all strings and update the character count in myMap.
Check if each character count is divisible evenly by the number of strings. If any character count is not divisible, return false.
If all checks pass, return true.
