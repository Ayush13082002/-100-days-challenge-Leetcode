Approach :
Calculate the number of tests a single pig can perform within the given time window: testsPerPig = timeToTest / timeToDie.
Initialize numPigs to keep track of the number of pigs needed, and states to keep track of the number of unique states that a single pig can represent (states start with 1 since a pig can either survive or die, so two possible states).
Enter a loop that continues until the number of states is greater than or equal to the number of buckets.
At each iteration, multiply the states by (testsPerPig + 1) since each pig can cover that many unique states.
Increment the numPigs by 1.
Once the loop ends, return the numPigs as the minimum number of pigs needed to solve the problem.
