Approach

Declare an integer pointer to track the expected decimal value for the next binary string.

Sort the input vector nums in lexicographical order.

Iterate through the sorted binary strings using a for loop:

Convert the current binary string to decimal.
Check if the decimal value matches the expected value (pointer).
If they match, increment pointer.
If not, return the binary representation of the expected value with the appropriate length.
If no binary string is found during the iteration, return the binary representation of the next expected value.
