Approach
Initialize two StringBuilder objects, str1 and str2, to build the concatenated strings for word1 and word2 respectively.
Iterate through each word in word1, appending it to str1.
Iterate through each word in word2, appending it to str2.
Convert both StringBuilder objects to strings, s1 and s2.
Compare s1 and s2. If they are equal, return true; otherwise, return false.
