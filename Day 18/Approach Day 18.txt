Approach
Initialize a boolean flag, areValuesSame, to track if the values of k and the first element in the row are the same.
Calculate the total number of elements in the nth row using the formula 2^(n-1).
Enter a loop that continues until you reach the first row (where n equals 1 and its element is 0):
Halve the number of elements in the row by dividing n by 2.
Check if k is in the second half of the current row by comparing it to n.
If k is in the second half, adjust its value by subtracting new n, and toggle the value of areValuesSame (if it was true, make it false, and vice versa).
Return 0 if the areValuesSame flag indicates that the values are the same; otherwise, return 1.
