Approach
Initialize two counts: count1 for starting with '0' and count2 for starting with '1'.
Use the count function to count the number of operations needed for each starting character. This function takes the string s and the previous character c_pre and returns the count of operations needed.
Compare count1 and count2 and return the minimum of the two.
