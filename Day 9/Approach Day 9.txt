Approach 
Each row of Pascal's Triangle can be represented using the sequence of combinations:
C(r,0),C(r,1),C(r,2),…,C(r,r)C(r, 0), C(r, 1), C(r, 2), \ldots, C(r, r)C(r,0),C(r,1),C(r,2),…,C(r,r)
where C(n,k)C(n, k)C(n,k) is the binomial coefficient, defined as:
C(n,k)=n!k!(n−k)!C(n, k) = \frac{n!}{k!(n-k)!}C(n,k)= 
k!(n−k)!
n!
​
 

The row's first element is always 1. Given the previous element in the row (prev), the next element can be calculated using:
next_val=prev×rowIndex−k+1k\text{next\_val} = \text{prev} \times \frac{\text{rowIndex} - k + 1}{k}next_val=prev× 
k
rowIndex−k+1
​
 
This formula is derived from the relationship between consecutive binomial coefficients in the same row.

Iterating from k = 1 to k = rowIndex, we can directly generate the elements for the desired row without building the entire triangle.
