Approach
Processing the String: To emulate the "typing" and "erasing" action, we navigate through each string with two pointers. The main pointer (i) traverses each character, while the auxiliary pointer (k for s and p for t) indicates the effective position of the last character post backspaces.

If the character at the main pointer isn't #, it's "typed" at the location of the auxiliary pointer, which is then incremented.
If the character is #, the preceding character is "erased" by decrementing the auxiliary pointer.
The concluding value of the auxiliary pointer after processing gives the effective string length after considering backspaces.
Comparing the Strings: After processing, the effective lengths (final values of k and p) are compared. A difference in lengths directly implies the strings aren't equal. If the lengths align, a character-by-character comparison is performed up to their effective lengths.

Pros
This approach is space efficient since it uses a constant amount of space.
Directly manipulates the input strings without creating new ones.
Cons
Might be a bit harder to conceptualize for someone unfamiliar with the two-pointer technique.
