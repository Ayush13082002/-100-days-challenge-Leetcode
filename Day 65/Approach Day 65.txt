Approach
Initialize variables size to store the size of the array, qtr to store 25% of the size, cnt to keep track of consecutive occurrences, and p to store the current integer being checked.
Iterate through the array starting from index 1.
Compare the current integer arr[i] with the previous integer p.
If they are equal, increment the count cnt.
If they are not equal, reset the count cnt to 1.
Check if the count cnt is greater than 25% of the array size qtr.
If true, return the current integer arr[i] as it occurs more than 25% of the time.
If false, update the previous integer p to the current integer arr[i].
If no integer is found during the iteration, return the last integer p as the answer.
