Approach
Initialize a variable res to store the result.
Convert the input string s into a character array for easy access.
Initialize a variable start to 0, which marks the start of a potential homogenous substring.
Iterate through the character array.
When a different character is encountered (c[i] != c[start]), calculate the number of homogenous substrings and add it to res. We do this by subtracting the start index from the current index (i - start) and adding the count to res. Then, update the start to the current index.
Continue this process until you reach the end of the string.
Calculate and add the number of homogenous substrings for the last homogenous substring.
Return the result res modulo 10^9 + 7.
