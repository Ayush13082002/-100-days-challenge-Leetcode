Approach
Initialize a variable ans to Integer.MAX_VALUE to keep track of the minimum sum of chocolate prices.
Iterate through each pair of chocolates using two nested loops.
For each pair (i, j), calculate the sum arr[i] + arr[j].
Update ans with the minimum of its current value and the calculated sum.
After the loops, calculate the leftover amount fin as key - ans.
If fin is non-negative, return fin; otherwise, return the initial money key.
