Approach:- 
Transition Matrix: First, we need to understand the transition for each vowel. We can build this based on the rules provided:

'a' can only be followed by 'e'
'e' can be followed by 'a' or 'i'
'i' cannot be followed by another 'i'
'o' can be followed by 'i' or 'u'
'u' can only be followed by 'a'
Dynamic Programming: We maintain a dynamic programming array for each vowel which will store the count of strings ending with that vowel for a particular length.

For n=1n = 1n=1, all vowels have a count of 1.
For each subsequent length, the count for each vowel is updated based on the previous counts of the other vowels.
For example, the count of strings of length iii ending with 'a' will be equal to the count of strings of length i−1i-1i−1 ending with 'e', because 'a' can only be followed by 'e'.
Modulo Operation: Since the answer can be large, we use modulo 109+710^9 + 710 
9
 +7 at each step to keep the numbers manageable.

Final Answer: The final answer will be the sum of counts of all vowels for length nnn.
