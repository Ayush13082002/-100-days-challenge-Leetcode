Approach
1. Recursive Traversal with Height Calculation:

The traverse function recursively explores the tree, searching for the target node with value targetVal.
It calls the height function to calculate the height of subtrees, which is used to determine the time needed to reach a leaf.
2. Target Node Tracking and Subtree Height:

When the target node is found, its subtree height is calculated using height and stored in targetSubtreeHeight.
This represents the time needed to reach a leaf from the target node.
3. Indirect Path Calculation:

For each non-target node, the function considers the potential indirect path that passes through it and its children.
It updates maxIndirect with the maximum distance between the current node's children, plus 1 for the current node itself.
4. Final Result:

The amountOfTime function initializes targetLeafLen (time to reach a leaf from the target node) and maxIndirect (longest indirect path).
It calls traverse to perform the traversal and calculations.
It returns the maximum of targetLeafLen and maxIndirect, representing the overall maximum time.
