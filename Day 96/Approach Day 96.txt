Approach

Depth-First Search (DFS):
Traverse the tree using DFS to explore all nodes.
Recursion:
Use a recursive function dfs that returns a pair of integers representing the minimum and maximum values encountered in the subtree rooted at the current node.
Update Maximum Difference:
Update the maximum difference m by comparing the differences between the current node's value and the minimum and maximum values in its subtree.
