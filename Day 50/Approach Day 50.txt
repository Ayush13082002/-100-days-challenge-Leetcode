Approach
Iterate through the matrix starting from the second row (i = 1).
For each cell matrix[i][j]:
If matrix[i][j] is 1, update it to store the height of consecutive 1s ending at this cell by adding the height of the previous row's corresponding cell (matrix[i - 1][j]).
After preprocessing, for each row, sort the row in non-decreasing order.
For each cell in the sorted row, calculate the area of the submatrix that ends at this cell, considering the consecutive 1s.
The area is given by height * width, where height is the height of consecutive 1s ending at this cell, and width is the position of the cell in the sorted row.
Update the maximum area accordingly.
Return the maximum area as the result.
