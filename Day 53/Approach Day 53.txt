Approach
Initialize a variable setBitCount to 0, which will store the count of set bits.
Use a while loop to iterate until the given integer n becomes 0.
Inside the loop, perform the operation n &= (n - 1). This operation clears the rightmost set bit in n.
Increment the setBitCount by 1.
Continue the loop until all set bits in n are cleared.
Return the final value of setBitCount.
