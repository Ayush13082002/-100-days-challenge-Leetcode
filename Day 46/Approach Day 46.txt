Approach
Initialization:Initialization:Initialization:

Initialize a variable count to keep track of the total number of elements in the result array.
Create an ArrayList of ArrayLists called lists to store the elements diagonally.
TraversingtheMatrixDiagonally:Traversing the Matrix Diagonally:TraversingtheMatrixDiagonally:

Use two nested loops to traverse each element in the matrix (nums).
For each element at position (i, j), calculate the diagonal index idx by adding i and j.
If the size of lists is less than idx + 1, it means we are encountering a new diagonal, so add a new ArrayList to lists.
Add the current element to the corresponding diagonal ArrayList in lists.
Increment the count to keep track of the total number of elements.
FlatteningDiagonalListstoResultArray:Flattening Diagonal Lists to Result Array:FlatteningDiagonalListstoResultArray:

Create an array res of size count to store the final result.
Initialize an index idx to keep track of the position in the result array.
FlattenDiagonalsinReverseOrder:Flatten Diagonals in Reverse Order:FlattenDiagonalsinReverseOrder:

Iterate over each diagonal ArrayList in lists.
For each diagonal, iterate in reverse order and add the elements to the result array (res).
Increment the index idx for each added element.
ReturnResultArray:Return Result Array:ReturnResultArray:

Return the final result array res.
