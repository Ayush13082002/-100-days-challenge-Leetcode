Approach
Iterate through the garbage array to check if there is Glass (G), Paper (P), or Metal (M) garbage in the city.
Calculate the initial time ans based on travel times between houses and the length of each garbage assortment.
Iterate backward through the houses and subtract travel times if a type of garbage is not present in that house.
Return the final value of ans.
