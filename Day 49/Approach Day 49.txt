Approach
First, calculate the total sum of the array. This sum will be used to compute the right part of the absolute differences.
Initialize two pointers, left and right, pointing to the start and end of the array.
Iterate through the array, and for each element nums[i], calculate the absolute difference sum by considering the left and right parts.
left represents the sum of elements to the left of nums[i].
right represents the sum of elements to the right of nums[i].
The absolute difference sum for nums[i] is calculated as n * i - left + right - n * (nums.length - i - 1).
Update the left pointer by adding the current element to it.
Update the right pointer by subtracting the current element from it.
Store the result in the output array r.
