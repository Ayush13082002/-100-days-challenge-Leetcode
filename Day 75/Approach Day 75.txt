Approach
Sort the points based on their x-coordinates.
Initialize a variable max_width to store the maximum width.
Iterate through the sorted points starting from index 1.
For each pair of consecutive points, calculate the width by subtracting the x-coordinate of the previous point from the x-coordinate of the current point.
Update max_width with the maximum of its current value and the calculated width.
After the iteration, max_width will contain the result.
