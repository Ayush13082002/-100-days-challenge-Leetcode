Approach ðŸš€
Sort the Array:

Sort the input array in ascending order. This step is crucial for pairing the smallest elements with the largest ones.
Initialize Pointers:

Initialize two pointers, left at the start of the array and right at the end of the array.
Initialize a Variable:

Create a variable (minMaxPairSum) to keep track of the minimum of the maximum pair sums. Initialize it to the smallest possible integer value.
Pairing Elements:

Iterate through the array using a while loop until the left pointer is less than the right pointer.
Calculate Current Pair Sum:

Calculate the sum of the pair of elements pointed to by the left and right pointers.
Update Minimum of Maximum Pair Sum:

Update minMaxPairSum by taking the maximum value between the current pair sum and the existing minMaxPairSum. This ensures that minMaxPairSum stores the minimum value encountered during the iteration.
Move Pointers Towards the Center:

Increment the left pointer and decrement the right pointer to move towards the center of the array.
Return the Result:

After the loop, return the calculated minMaxPairSum as the final result.
