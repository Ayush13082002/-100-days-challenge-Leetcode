Approach
Iterate through each row of the bank and calculate the number of security devices in that row (curRowCount).
For each non-empty row, calculate the number of laser beams that can be formed between devices in the current row and devices in the previous row (prevRowCount).
Update the total count of laser beams.
Return the total count.
